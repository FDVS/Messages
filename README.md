# Messages

Messages is a chrome app that combines multiple instant messaging networks into one.

This is not an official product by any of the messaging companies in this app. This was created as a free and open source project. 

## Introduction
Still quite new to Chrome Apps. A lot of the stuff like notifications is done through a crude hack. I'll revisit these at a later date. (Or if you want to help out, do a Pull Request!)

Currently supports the following IM networks:

  - Whatsapp
  - Facebook Messenger
  - WeChat

If you want any more IM networks being added, just submit an Issue and I'll look into it later. Make sure that a web version of that IM is available.

### Version
1.0.0

### Installation

This isn't a packaged app yet, so for now:

 - Download the Zip repository
 - Unzip it somewhere
 - Go to Chrome and open up chrome://extensions/
 - Make sure "Developer Mode" is on (Top Right corner)
 - "Load Unpacked Extension"
 - Navigate to where you unzipped the repo and press Select.
 - Press "Launch" and you're done!
